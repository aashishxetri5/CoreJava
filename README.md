# CoreJava
You are tasked with designing an Employee Management System for a small company using Object-Oriented Programming concepts in Java. The system should allow the company to manage its employees' information, such as name, age, department, and salary.

## Requirements

### Create a class Employee with the following private attributes

```
String name
int age
String department
double salary
```

### Implement the following methods in the Employee class
  * A constructor to initialize all the attributes.
  * Getter and setter methods for each attribute.
  * A method `raiseSalary(double percentage)` that increases the employee's salary by a given percentage.
  * A method `displayEmployeeInfo()` that prints out the employee's information in a readable format.


### Create a Manager class that inherits from the Employee class. The Manager class should have an additional attribute

`double bonus`

### Implement the following in the Manager class
 * A constructor that initializes the manager's attributes including those inherited from the Employee class.
 * A method `calculateTotalSalary()` that returns the total salary `(base salary + bonus).`
 * Override the `displayEmployeeInfo()` method to include the bonus information.

### Create a main method in a class EmployeeTest that
 * Creates an instance of `Employee`.
 * Creates an instance of `Manager`.
 * Displays the information of both the employee and the manager.
 * Raises the salary of both the employee and the manager by `10%`.
 * Displays the updated information of both.
